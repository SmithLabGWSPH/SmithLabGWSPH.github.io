Welcome to Smith Lab at the [George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health](https://publichealth.gwu.edu/)! 
We are a research group led by Dr. Emily Smith that focuses on infection and nutrition across the life course. Our goal is to generate, analyze, and translate epidemiological data to improve maternal, newborn, and child health globally. Our current and past projects include randomized trials, surveillance, and health service program evaluation in Tanzania, Ghana, Zambia, Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda, Bolivia, Peru, Afghanistan, India, Pakistan, and the United States. 

You can find our work featured on the likes of CNN, the Washington Post, and Fortune. See some of our recent media coverage below.
